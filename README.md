# Smart Energy Tracker

We welcome contributions to Smart Energy Tracker, a real-time energy monitoring and inverter control system. Whether you want to add features, fix bugs, improve performance, or enhance the user experience, your contribution is valuable!

---

## Features

- Real-time inverter status updates
- Battery level monitoring with low-battery warnings
- Energy consumption tracking
- Temperature and humidity monitoring with high-temperature warnings
- Manual and automatic control of inverter
- Event timeline and notifications
- Interactive charts and dashboards
- Mock WebSocket server for testing

---

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js, Vite, CSS
- Backend (mock server): Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO
- State management: React Context
- Charts & visualization: Custom components

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+ (recommended)
- npm v9+ (comes with Node.js)
- Git

---

1. Adding Features or Components

What to contribute

New React components (dashboard widgets, status cards).
Utilities and helper functions.
Backend/mock-server features or API endpoints.
Examples
Real-time charts for energy consumption, battery levels, inverter status.
Custom notifications for low battery, power cuts, critical events.
Dashboard widgets for historical trends and analysis.



Where to place code

Frontend components → src/components/
Utilities → src/utils/
Backend/mock logic → server/



Best practices

Write clean, maintainable code with comments.
Follow existing folder structure and naming conventions.

2. Bug Fixes

Common issues
WebSocket connection errors or dropped messages.
Incorrect mock-data simulation or real-time update problems.
UI misalignment or broken responsive behavior.
Memory leaks (e.g., intervals not cleared).



Steps

Locate files (src/ for frontend, server/ for backend).
Create a bug branch, fix, and test locally.
Commit with a descriptive message and open a PR referencing the issue.



3. Performance Optimization

Goals
Improve responsiveness, reduce CPU/load, minimize UI lag.
Ideas
Optimize WebSocket emission frequency and update logic.
Debounce/throttle frequent UI updates.
Lazy-load heavy components or charts.
Compress and optimize assets (images/icons).



4. (previously 5) Testing & Quality Assurance



What to add
Unit tests for React components (Jest + React Testing Library).
Integration tests for WebSocket flows (mock server).
Steps
Add tests under src/__tests__/ or server/__tests__/.
Run tests locally and ensure they pass on multiple devices/browsers.

5. (previously 6) UI / UX Improvements
   

Focus areas
Mobile responsiveness and layout polishing.
Color schemes for warnings (low battery, high temp, power cut).
Smooth animations for updates and transitions.
Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard nav, color contrast.


Steps

Update styles in src/index.css or component-level CSS.
Test across devices/resolutions.



6. (previously 8) Real-Time Data & Mock Server

Enhancements
Add mock sensors: voltage, current, power factor.
Simulate seasonal or daily usage patterns.
Better random event simulation (power cuts, manual overrides).
Ensure mock payloads match frontend expectations.



Files

Server mock code → server/mock-socket-server.js
Optional dev helpers → src/utils/mockSocketServer.js



7. Challenges & Opportunities (short)


WebSocket stability — improve reconnect & retry logic.
Alerts accuracy — handle edge cases (e.g., power-cut + low battery).
Dashboard performance — reduce chart lag with high-frequency updates.
Responsive UI — perfect mobile behavior on smaller screens.
Test coverage — add unit/integration tests.
Code cleanup — remove redundant code in mock server/utilities.
Security — validate & sanitize incoming socket data.
Feature expansion — scheduling, historical charts, user preferences.



8. Content Guidelines & Quality Standards

   

What to include
Functional, well-tested code.
Clear commit messages and documentation.
Well-structured components and utilities.
Respectful and constructive contributions.
Quality checks
Verify real-time updates & notifications behave correctly.
Test changes on multiple devices before PR.
Keep consistent styling, naming, and folder structure.
Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies.
Quick Setup & Run (point-wise commands)
