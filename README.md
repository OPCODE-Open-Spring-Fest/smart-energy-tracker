- Energy consumption tracking
- Temperature and humidity monitoring with high-temperature warnings
- Manual and automatic control of inverter
- Event timeline and notifications
- Interactive charts and dashboards
- Mock WebSocket server for testing

---

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js, Vite, CSS
- Backend (mock server): Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO
- State management: React Context
- Charts & visualization: Custom components

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+ (recommended)
- npm v9+ (comes with Node.js)
- Git

How to Contribute

1. Adding Features or Components

Contribute new React components, utilities, or backend features.
Examples include:
Real-time charts for energy consumption, battery levels, or inverter status
Custom notifications for low battery, power cuts, or system events
Dashboard widgets for historical trends and analysis

Steps:
Place new frontend components in src/components/
Place utilities in src/utils/
Backend logic (mock server, API endpoints) in server/
Write clean, maintainable code and include comments
Follow the existing folder structure for easy integration

2. Bug Fixes

Help identify and fix issues in frontend, backend, or server logic.
Common issues to address:
WebSocket connection errors or dropped messages
Incorrect mock data simulation or real-time updates
UI misalignment or broken responsive design
Memory leaks due to intervals not being cleared

Steps:

Locate relevant files (src/ for frontend, server/ for backend)
Fix the issue and test locally
Include clear, descriptive commit messages

3. Performance Optimization

Improve the app’s responsiveness, load time, and efficiency.
Examples:
Optimize WebSocket update intervals and reduce unnecessary emissions
Debounce or throttle frequent frontend updates
Lazy-load heavy components or charts
Compress assets (images, icons)

5. Testing & Quality Assurance

Ensure system reliability and bug-free performance.

Examples of tests to implement:
Unit tests for React components (using Jest + React Testing Library)
Integration tests for WebSocket events and real-time updates

Steps:
Add test files in the appropriate folder (src/__tests__/ or server/__tests__/)
Run tests locally before submitting
Ensure all tests pass on multiple devices

6. UI / UX Improvements

Improve the dashboard, charts, notifications, or controls.
Suggested areas for improvement:
Dashboard mobile responsiveness
Color schemes for low battery, high temperature, or power cut warnings
Animations for transitions or data updates
Accessible design (ARIA labels, color contrast)

7. Real-Time Data & Mock Server

Enhance or expand the mock WebSocket server:
Add new mock sensors (voltage, current, power factor)
Simulate seasonal or usage patterns
Improve random event simulation (power cuts, manual overrides)
Ensure mock data structure aligns with frontend requirements
Issues & Opportunities for Contribution


7.Here are some current challenges and opportunities in the project:


WebSocket Stability: Connection drops or reconnection logic needs improvement.
Battery & Inverter Alerts: Notifications for edge cases (e.g., sudden power cut + low battery) need testing.
Dashboard Optimization: Charts sometimes lag on real-time updates; frontend performance improvements needed.
Responsive Design: Ensure UI works perfectly on all devices, especially smaller screens.
Testing Coverage: Unit and integration tests are minimal; need more automated tests.
Code Cleanup: Remove redundant code in mock server and frontend utilities.
Security: Validate and sanitize incoming WebSocket messages to prevent crashes.
Feature Expansion: Implement scheduling, historical data charts, or user preferences.

8.Content Guidelines
What to Include
Functional and well-tested code
Clear commit messages and documentation
Well-structured components and utilities
Respectful and constructive contributions
Quality Standards
Verify real-time updates and notifications work correctly
Test new features locally on multiple devices
Maintain consistent styling, naming, and file structure
Optimize performance and avoid unnecessary dependencies

2.Clone & install
git clone <repo-url>
cd invertorguard
npm install

3.Start mock socket server (dev demo)
# in one terminal
npm run mock-server
# (script maps to node server/mock-socket-server.js)

4.Start frontend
# in another terminal
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:5173

5.Install frontend dependencies
npm install
npm install express socket.io cors
